## I messed up my back.

It is been a week and a half since I started doing diet and exercise. I lost almost 10kg. I guess I was a little cocky.

Back then, I used to deadlift 160 to 180kg for main set. Today, I started with 60kg, and I felt something terribly wrong. I dropped the weight and fell.

Could not wake up for almost 10 min.

I started this just to become healthy. I thought this was not fair. But more than that, I was scared. I was scared about my life. What if I can't pursue my dream? What if I can't do what I have to do? What if I can't do what I love?

What if I am useless that people will leave me?

Well, now this was stupid.
I am now lying on my bed. Can't move a bit. I am not even sure how I am supposed to go to lab tomorrow. How about conference I have next week and next next week?

This is crazy.
This is a sign.

Please, stop being cocky. You still have a lot to lose, and none of them is yours.

Remember, you never achived anything on your own. You are just a tool. You are just a tool to serve others. You are just a tool to serve God.
