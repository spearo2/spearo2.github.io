# Starting this blog..

I am only an undergraduate student in Computer Science, but I am starting this blog hoping that my posts will be able to spread knowledge about software engineering and its importance. I will mainly deal with software engineering and other topics related to my research and interests. My main interests are in the automatic program repair and defect prediction algorithms. Also, I am interested in the sports science and the quantum computing.

My goal is to solve the NP problem or suggest a practical solution for the automation of software maintainances. Most of my research is also related to that problem. Hope my posts will be helpful to people who are interested in software engineering.
