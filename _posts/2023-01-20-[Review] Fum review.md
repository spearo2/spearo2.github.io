# Yep, I failed

I failed to quit nicotine.
I don't quite remember when I exactly started smoking again, but I am pretty sure I passed 100 days.
I mean I vaped. Then, A few weeks ago I ordered a product called FUM.

[FUM's official website](https://tryfum.com/)

## This is what it looks like

The product is a wooden stick that is supposed to help you quit smoking. 

It is consisted of 3 parts. The first part is a wooden stick, the second part is a metal pipe, and the last part is a herb refill kind of thing.

White thing in the metal pipe is the herb.

## How does it work?

It is basically inhaling the minty air.
- There is no ignition
- There is no nicotine or substances that is not naturally breathed in the air.

I ordered it from the states to South Korea.

I ordered the journey pack and shipping cost was around $20.

I think total in american dollars was around $100.

## How does it feel?

At the beginning, I was so confused. I was like "What the hell is this?". I was expecting something like a vape, but it was actually an air pipe.


Journey pack has three flavor
- Maple Pepper
- Crisp Mint
- White Cranberry

Simply put, except the mint flavor which kindda hits your throat similar to the minty cigs. The other two are just complete crap.

So, I just breathe this thing whenever I crave for a cig.
And.. I guess it works.
Just buy mint flavor and just hold it in your mouth for hours and hours.

## Pros

- It does not emit visible smoke
- It does not smell bad
- It probably does nothing to your body
- If you keep inhaling it, it kindda wakes you up similar to how cigs do wake you up.
- Smoke detectors won't know you fuming. Meaning that you can smoke this anywhere you want if people around you are okay with it.
- No fire, no burning, no carbon emission, no nicotine, no tar, no smell, no ash, no nothing, just the wood stick and the air.

## Cons
- It is expensive if you are not in the states.
- It still does smell like herbs. So, if you are in a closed space with someone, they will know you are fuming.

## your throat will be sore that you will not be able to feel like smoking for a while.

I will try this for awhile and see if this thing actually finishes my 20 years of smoking carrer.
