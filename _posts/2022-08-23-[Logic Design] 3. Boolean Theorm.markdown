# Boolean Theorem

1. IdentitY Element
X = 0 = X, X x 1 = X

2. Null Element
X + 1 = 1, X x 0 = 0

3. X + X = X, X x X = X

4. (X')' = X

5. X + X' = 1, X x X' = 0

6. Commutative Law
X + Y = Y = X, X x Y = Y x X

7. Assiciative Law
(X + Y) + Z = X + (Y + Z)

8. Distributive Law
X x (Y + Z) = XY + XZ
X + (Y x Z) = (X + Y) x (X + Z)

9. Absorption Theorem
X + XY = X
X x (X + Y) = X

10. X + X'Y = X + Y
    X x (X + Y) = XY

11. XY + XY' = X
    (X + Y) x (X + Y') = X

12. Consencus Theorem
XY + X'Z + YZ = XY + XZ
(X + Y) x (X' + Z) x (y + Z) = (X + Y) x (X + Z)

13. DeMorgan's Theorem
(X + Y)' = X'Y'
(XY)' = X' + Y'
