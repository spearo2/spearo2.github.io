# The shortest yet greatest year of my life
## 33 posts
It has been little over one year since I started this blog.<br>
Many have changed yet many have been lost.

I learned a lot, thanks to my professor.
It just comes to my mind that I could have always done things better.
With the regrets behind, I would like to see what is emotional rather than the bunch of subjects that I have learned or achieved.

look at this graph.<br>
I am rolling down into the valley of depair, the valley that seems endless.<br>
One of the biggest thought? It is that I don't belong where I am now.<br>
People are talented and hardworking. This is the place where I started to believe that genius people don't exist.<br>
There only exists hardworking people with vision. And hopefully I should have been one of those people.<br>

I continuously thought that I must be one of them, well no I continuosely started to doubt my self that I am not.<br>
I am not them and what I can do is critically tiny.<br>
My ambition does not seem to be good enough to hold my pain.<br>

Our lab calls it 맷집, The tolerance or endurance strength.<br>
I believe the endless downhill of my confidence will soon reach its end.<br>
And I will start to rise like everyone else.<br>
I just have to take faster and bigger steps each day.<br>
Prof said the quality our lab seeks in our members is the 맷집.<br> 

Will I make it?<br>
Let's find out next year.<br>
Thinking about the amount of knowledge. It was indeed the greatest yet shortest year of my life.<br>
My routine was home to lab to home, repeatedly.<br>
I fucked up my knee for rushing to the lab.<br>
I fucked up my back while deadlifting after sitting and not moving for days.<br>
I fucked up my shoulder for coding on a small ass keyboard over days.<br>

What more can I fuck up.<br>
I strongly hope the coming year will be the year of recovery and progress.<br>
I am so done with the fucking ups.<br>

I am not giving up. I chose it so I shall see the very end of it.<br>
Hells no. I ain't giving up.
