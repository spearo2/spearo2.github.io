I am leaving this post here, so that I will be reminded of today.

It has been rough 5 years.
I had to give up college at my fourth year because of immigration issues.
I was a proud american soldier, but the "Trumph" policy kicked me out of the country.

Then, I served Korean army.
I worked at a start-up company for 2 years.
Then, I transfered my UMass Amherst transcript to a Korean university called Handong Global University.

I was always an econ major, but I was so facinated by CS community and that is how I changed my major.
I joined software engineering lab led by JC my favorite teacher for life.

Under his guidance, I learned a lot of things.
His vision gave me passion.
Passion that does not pursue own happiness, but the happiness of others.
The service, the love, the passion. For our neighbors, for our friends, for our family.

I joined various projects, turned in 2 papers in korean conference.

I got rejected too. it was at an international conferece.

I graduated with the title of summa cum laude.
I never paid for my tuition fees. I was always on scholarship.
I grinded.

One year, I lost 30 kg of weight.
Another year, I gained 50 kg back.

My body kept screaming that what I am doing won't last forever.
I was always on the edge of breaking down.

But here I leave the loved ones behind.
I am grateful that I got accepted to the best university in Korea to pursue my vision.

I grinded, yet nothing was done on my own.
God, teachers, friends, family, and all the loved ones.

I thank you all.
