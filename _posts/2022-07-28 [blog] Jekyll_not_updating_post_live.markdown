# Jekyll Posts Not being updated on the Github Live Server but works on a local. 

I have been spending a good amount of time debugging why <a href="https://spearo2.github.io/research/2022/07/27/SoberLog-First_Ten_Days.html">this post</a> would not be recognized by the Github live server.

Github Live Server would not allow you to write a post that is written from the future date.
I am currently in South Korea, So currently at 2:30 AM Jul 28th has not come in the states.

Well, that was pretty stupid.
