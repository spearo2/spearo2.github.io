# Yay, its been 10 days

<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/life/sober_cig2.png/" width="auto" height="auto" alt="cig2">

since I decided to quit nicotine and guess what,
It is going great.

This is an app called <a href="https://iamsober.com/">I am sober</a>. 
This is the daily notes I recorded. I captured it cause the way my mood fluctuates every day is just hilarious.

## Honestly, I am still not 100% sure if I will successfully quit. So it is perhaps too early to say anything about quitting ciggarretts.

But I writing this down hoping that my testimony could encourage someone. (Or maybe I will be reading this years later and laughing)

I have smoked for over 15 years, and attempted quitting almost 100 times. 
Obviously I failed all the time.

I failed because I was always trying to find an alternative for urges I get from nicotine.
I tried Juuls, IQOS, and vapors of different kinds. I chewed nicotine gums and also tried patches.
I tried to slowly reduce the number of ciggarretts I smoke, and also tried sleeping a whole day to avoid resisting the urges and withdrawals.

This time I just literally stopped nicotine intakes.
I did not try to look for alternatives, but rather became ragous.

Literally, everything pissed me off. I tried not meeting people for this matter, but did not sleep.
I resisted it.

## For day 1~4

I was extremely unstable phychologically. I craved food and also punching walls and kicking things for no reason.
I tried to drink a lot of water whenever the cravings came back, but did not help.

I understood that the mood fluctations are just chemical reactions from my brain.
I doubted if this shitty feeling would ever end.

I kept being absent minded. And could not focus on anything.
My code I wrote for hours just did not make any sense and the depression gave me even stronger cravings.

I thought that perhaps it is better to smoke and live a happy life even if I die with a lung cancer.

## For day 5~8

The crazy emotional fluctations significantly reduced in number.
I tended to work longer because I just had no idea how to take breaks without smokes.
It obviously didn't work. I bought a stress ball and lots of coconut water.

Stress ball was to suppress my anger and the coconut water was to wash out nicotine in my blood stream as fast as possible.

I just had to learn how to take breaks like a normal human being.

Actually, at this point I was wondering how non-smokers relieve stresses.

There must be a legitemate way to do that without smokes which I would never know because I have been smoking for way too long.

## Today

I just kept taking a walk for 10 minutes whenever my muscle memory knew that it is the time for the smoking breaks.
I did that for 5 times then I realized that I just need to relax somehow. 
I could take a walk or a nap. I could play a game or I could read something interesting.

I just did not know this becuase I have been just siting at the smoking area watching facebook or instagram reels.


## Overall...

I gained about 7kg so I started my diet as well today.
I started coughing a lot these days.

Other than that I am not sure if there is any postive changes on my body.
But I just don't feel like smoking anymore, really.

I would like to share about my motivations and all that if I hit one month or more.
Hope this feeling lasts lol.
