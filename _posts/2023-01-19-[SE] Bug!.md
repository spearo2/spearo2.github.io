# What is a bug?

Software testing, Program analysis, and program synthesis. Across the dynamic and static analysis, we use terms like defect prediction, bug finder, fault localization, bug localization and so on. 

I was just thinking why do they use different terms for the same thing. 

For example, FL and BL are just completely different methods.

### Would the definitions of the terms be different then?

The term <u>software reliability</u> is defined as "The probability of failure-free software operation for a specified period of time in a specified environment"[1]

So, the definition gives out the term failure first.
let's start from failure.
#### What is failure?

A failure is the inability of a software system or component to perform its required functions within specified performance requirements. 

So basically, when a defect reaches the end customer it is called a Failure. During development, Failures are usually observed by testers[2].

#### Then, What is defect?

Defect is defined as the difference between the actual outcomes and the expected outcomes throughout the calculated semantics.

#### We are almost there! 
#### What is bug?

I could not find the legit definition of bug. It is probably because the term bug was first derived by actual bug(moth) trapped in Mark 2 machine in 1870.

But, apperently, it is widely used for defects that is reported during the developing stage.

#### Now, then, Fault means..?

Any anomaly in the software. Meaning the software at the testing stage, possibly before the touch of the end-user.

This is why FL and BL are different. FL is for the software that is being tested and perhaps already released to the end-user, and BL is for the software that is still in the development stage.

#### Error..?
when we say bugs, we usually mean errors. But, error is a subset of bugs.

Bugs include many other defects such as security vulnerabilities, performance issues like memory leakage, and so on.

While surveying, I realized that the terms are used interchangeably in real development field.

However, I think it has to be clearly defined in terms of software engineering. Developers are not scholars.
This is probably our job to do so.
