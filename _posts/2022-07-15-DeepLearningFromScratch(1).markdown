# Deep Learning From the Scratch (1)

Today, the word "deep learning" is literally found everywhere. The field of software engineering is not an exception. Semantic and syntatic features of source codes have been represented with very high accuracy using the deep learning algorithms.

<a herf="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3395363.3397369">CoCoNuT: combining context-aware neural translation models using ensemble for program repair</a>
<a herf="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8812062">A Novel Neural Source Code Representation Based on Abstract Syntax Tree</a>

Above two papers are good examples of the source code representation via the deep learning algorithm. CoCoNuT uses a neural translation model for the automatic program repair (APR). On the other hand, The next paper (ASTNN, shortly) uses a bidirectional reccurent neural network to represent an abstract syntax tree (AST).

Now, these being said, 
## what on earth is deep learning?

In this serise of posts, I would like to talk about the history and intuitive development of Deep Learning. Less maths and more visual representation, if possible.

Also, I would like to connect the idea to the field of software engineering.
