This is a link to the publically accessible paper.

It has been quite a difficult time for me trying to quit nicotine past weeks.

Coughs, phlegm, ichiness, and insomnia are just small side effects. In fact, what is driving me crazy is the hormonal changes that causes unstable fluctuations of emotions. I often become intolerant to small things and forget things. I have been having hard time focusing on things. 

## This is just a little bit of a testimonies before I decided to look for academic resources what excatly is happening in my freaking brain ever since I quit.

So this paper is only cited 83 times. Considering that it was published 2015 and the topic, it is quite low numbers. I do not really know journals and conferences in medical fields and this is also not related to the hormonal changes I was talking about, but it seemed interesting.

I am not going to deep into the environmental settings related to stem cells as I am not good enough to explain this stuff, so if you are interested please visit the above link. This is going to be a short review of the paper I guess.

As the Fig1. shows, this paper discovers that both electronic ciggarretts and actual tobacco effects the development of the development of heart.

However, tobacco sverely increases the heart defect rate and the severity of it.

In above graphs, N = Nicoting, E = E-Cigarettes, and T = Tobacco.


The paper tries to warn especially the pregnent women about the impact of the E-ciggarretts on the heart development of a child.
Although, it is shown that the E-ciggarretts showed the drastically low risk in hearts than the normal tobacco, 

## Basically saying that e-ciggarretts cannot be a safer alternative.

In this experiment, vapors with a cartomizer fluid (just the vapor we all know) are used.

However, this does not deal with the new generation of the E-ciggarretts like Juuls and IQOS.

I mean it is supposed to be none of my business cause I decided to completely cut out nicotine.

OMG I am craving again.
